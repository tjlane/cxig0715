NOTES on reviving old data processing

  1. It seems that the old scratch/ spaces are gone. I hacked around this by using space in my home directory for the time being.

  2. The following conda environment works, EXCEPT for the XTCAV code, which wants the cv2 library. So... you have to figure out how to install that.

THESE COMMANDS BASICALLY WORK:

  goconda
  conda activate ana-409-tj
  cd analysis/cxig0715/cxig0715/
  mpirun -n 8 python preprocess.py -r 129 --onecolor

Not attempted, but should be fine:

  sbatch -p psanaq --nodes 1 --ntasks-per-node 8 --wrap="mpirun python preprocess.py -r 129"

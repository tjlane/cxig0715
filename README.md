This repository contains code, data, and metadata employed by Stransky et. al. in the course of XFEL pump/XFEL probe studies on liquid water (LCLS experiment LG07 in 2015, conducted at CXI). 

Specifically, it contains:

* Code used to process X-ray diffraction data from the LCLS and estimate WAXS curves (requires a psana environment)
* Scripts and notebooks to interrograte this data, sort, and summarize it
* Summary data describing I(q, time, power) for the experiments
* Summary data describing I(q, time, power) for the associated simulations
* Code employed to make all figures displayed in the manuscript reporting the work

Code and data are provided "as-is" for the purpose of transparency and reproducability, without any warranty, express or implied. Code was not intended to presist beyond the scope of the specific scientfic project and is not actively maintained nor extensively documented.

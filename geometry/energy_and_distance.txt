From Sebastien:
~25 eV above the iron edge for the pump and 25 eV below the iron edge for the
probe.

From eLog posts by tbarends:

lysozyme detector calibration results.
We are using the same detector we had for cxid6014 (myoglobin.CO) in the summer. Starting from that geometry and the powder made
by Lutz, shifted the quadrants to approximately the right position.
Then scanned various detector distances. 94 mm seems more or less optimal and gives 20% indexing rate.

Optimization with the geometry optimization code using 20,000 Bragg reflections then improves the indexing rate to >50%. 

Will let it run and use the result for another iteration.
Plots attached.

detector encoder offset is 566.5 mm

ion*: average ionization degree of oxygen
first column: time[fs], 0fs = center of the pump pulse
second column: average ionization degree [-]

csp*: charge state population
first column: time[fs], 0fs = center of the pump pulse
columns 2 and higher give relative populations (0 to 1) of ionization stages of oxygen (neutral,1+,..)

note: figures do not show all columns that are included in data files.

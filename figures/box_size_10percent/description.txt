first column: q[1/meter]
second column: scattered intensity, [arbitrary units] but normalized always the same - 
   per incident probe photon and per scattering particle in the cell.
   This is because the number of scattering particles in cells of different sizes (30,47 and 60Å) differ.
   Technically it was done by renormalizing to the number of atoms in cell of the size of 47Å.
